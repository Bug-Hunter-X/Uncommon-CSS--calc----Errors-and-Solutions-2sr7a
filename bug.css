The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations. However, there are some uncommon errors that can occur if the syntax isn't perfect. For example, if you have spaces between the operator and operands, this will lead to an error.  This means `width: calc(100% - 20px)` works but `width: calc( 100% - 20px )` fails. Another issue can be related to using units inconsistently, such as mixing percentages and pixels without proper parentheses grouping.  For example, `height: calc(50% + 10px * 2)` might not work as expected, but `height: calc(50% + (10px * 2))` would.
